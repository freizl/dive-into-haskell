- Normal Form
  - fully evaluated
- Weak Head Normal Form
- ~seq a _~ ~a~ will be evaluated to *WHNF*
- lambda function is already *Normal Form*
  - because lambda function can not be further reduced until more arguments
- Convert function to Normal Form?
  - convert function to lambda expression/function
- Normal Form implies WHNF
- In summary, what is WHNF
  1. a data structure
  2. lambda expression
  3. built-in function applied to too few arguments.
- use ~:sprint~ in ghci to un-evaluated data, a.k.a Thunk
