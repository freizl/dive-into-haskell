#+TITLE: Introduction to type level programming

* Notes
- Exercise of [[https://rebeccaskinner.net/posts/2021-08-25-introduction-to-type-level-programming.html][this blog post]]
- Kind of a Type.
  #+begin_src haskell
:kind! Maybe
Maybe :: Type -> Type
  #+end_src

- Is the mental model like /Maybe/ is type level /function/ that takes a type(kind) and return a type(kind)?
- e.g. at value level, ~1~ has type ~Int~, at type level, ~1~ has kind ~Nat~

* Command

#+begin_src sh
cabal v2-clean
cabal --jobs=2 v2-build all
#+end_src
