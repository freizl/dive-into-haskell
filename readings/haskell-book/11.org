#+TITLE: Chapter 11 Algebraic Datatypes

* Reading notes
1. Data constructor arities
   - nullary :: take zero arguments. e.g. ~data Foo = Foo~
   - unary :: take 1 arguments. e.g. ~data Foo = Foo Int~
   - binary :: take 2 arguments?
   - products :: take 1+ arguments. e.g. ~data Foo = Foo Bool Int~
2. What makes those datatypes algebraic?
   - /sum/ v.s. /product/
   - can be explained in terms of /cardinality/.
     #+begin_quote
     The cardinality of a datatype is the number of possible values it defines
     #+end_quote
   - nullary data constructor has cardinality 1
   - unary data constructor has same cardinality as the parameter
   - Sum type: cardinality is sum from cardinality of either inhabitant.
     + ~e.g. data Bool = True | False~, has 2
   - Product type: cardinality is result of multiplication
     #+begin_src haskell
     -- cardinality is 2 * 256 (2^8 of Int8)
     data TwoB = MkTB Bool Int8
     #+end_src
   - Why need to understand cardinality
     #+begin_quote
     The reason itâ€™s important to understand cardinality is that the cardinality of a datatype roughly equates to how difficult it is to reason about.
     #+end_quote
     #+begin_src haskell
data Quantum = Yes | No | Both

convert :: Quantum -> Bool
convert Yes = True
        No = True
        Both = True

        Yes = False
        No = True
        Both = True

        Yes = True
        No = False
        Both = True

        Yes = True
        No = True
        Both = False

        Yes = False
        No = False
        Both = True

        Yes = True
        No = False
        Both = False

        Yes = False
        No = True
        Both = False

        Yes = False
        No = False
        Both = False
     #+end_src
   - Functional type is exponential
     #+begin_example
f :: Bool -> Bool -- 2^2
f :: a -> b -- b^a
     #+end_example
3. chapter 11, ~coolestWord~, how to determine word?
   - it is not related to previous functions. just counting which /word/ appears most.
