1. Monoid of functions
   #+begin_src haskell
   instance Monoid b => Monoid (a->b) where
     -- follow the type
     -- since the b has monoid instance
     -- the implementation is probably concat `b` internally
     -- but on the surface, result of `<>` is still function
     -- because `<>` take 2 `a` and returns `a`
     f <> g = \x -> f x <> g x
                 -- ^ b    ^ b
