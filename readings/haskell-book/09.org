#+TITLE: Chapter 09 Lists

* Reading notes
1. list ranges
   - ~[1..10]~
   - looks like syntax sugar of using functions from ~Enum~ type class
2. Spines and non-strict evaluation
   - /spine/ - connective structure that ties the collection of values
   - ~sprint~ - print variables and see what has been evaluated. ~_~ means isn't evaluated.
3. Spines are evaluated independently of values
4. NF implies WHNF
   - NF :: Normal Form, expression is fully evaluated
   - WHNF :: Weak Head Normal Form, expression is only evaluated to reach a data constructor
