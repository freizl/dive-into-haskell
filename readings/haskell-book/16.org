#+TITLE: Chapter 16 Functor

* Reading notes
1. ~TypeApplications~ language extension
   #+begin_src haskell
:t fmap @Maybe
(a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
   #+end_src
2. functor law
   - ~fmap id = id~
   - ~fmap (f . g) = fmap f . fmap g~
3. natural transformations
   #+begin_src haskell
{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}
type Nat f g = forall a. f a -> g a
   #+end_src
4. Functors are unique
   #+begin_quote
Functor instances will be unique for a given datatype.
We saw that this isn’t true for Monoid—we use newtypes to preserve the unique pairing
of a Monoid instance to a type.
But Functor instances will be unique for a datatype,
in part because of parametricity, in part because arguments to type constructors
are applied in order of definition
