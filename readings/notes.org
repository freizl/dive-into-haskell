* Type

The combination of ~::~ and the type after it is called a _type signature_.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
ghci> 'a' :: Char
'a'
ghci> [1,2,3] :: Int

<interactive>:1:0:
    Couldn't match expected type `Int' against inferred type `[a]'
    In the expression: [1, 2, 3] :: Int
    In the definition of `it': it = [1, 2, 3] :: Int

* Miscs

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
let x = exp 1    -- let is special for GHCI to assign a variable
[1,2,3]          -- a list
(1,2,"Yes")      -- tuple
a `plus` b = a + b   -- infix function
[1,2] ++ [3,4]       --
[1,2] : [3,4]        -- ERROR
:info .
:info $
::               -- can be read “has type”
